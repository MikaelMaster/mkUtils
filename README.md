# mkUtils - **END OF SUPPORT** on July, 24 2023.
# Finish version: 1.2.8 (In gradle v1.2), last build using Kotlin v1.8.22
An utils plugin for Minecraft Kotlin developers (Supports 1.17+, for 1.8 use [mkUtilsLegacy](https://github.com/MikaelMaster/mkUtilsLegacy)).

Thanks to my best coder friend, Koddy, for the help with this project. https://github.com/KoddyDev <br>
Also credits to Eduard for the base for mkUtils, the EduardAPI. https://github.com/EduardMaster

Now I'll continue developing and updating just the mkUtilsLegacy as I need it.
