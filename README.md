An utils plugin for Minecraft Kotlin developers (Supports 1.17+, for 1.8 use ![mkUtilsLegacy](https://github.com/MikaelMaster/mkUtilsLegacy)).

Thanks to my best coder friend, Koddy, for the help with this project. https://github.com/KoddyDev <br>
Also credits to Eduard for the base for mkUtils, the EduardAPI. https://github.com/EduardMaster

Now I'll continue developing and updating just the mkUtilsLegacy as I need it.
